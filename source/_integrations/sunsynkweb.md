The `sunsynkweb` integration allows one to use the [Sunsynk](http://sunsynk.org) web api to retrieve the status and history of inverters, batteries and solar panels installation.
This integration simply presents as sensors the primary attributes of the inverters. 
The integration only needs you to define your `username` and `password`, the same that you would use on their mobile phone app or on http://sunsynk.net.
