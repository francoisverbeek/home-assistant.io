The **Sunsynk web** {% term integration %} gathers statistics from [Sunsynk connect](http://sunsynk.org). It exposes real-time and historical information.

This will log into your Sunsynk account and will collate the information of any plants or inverters and present the main sensors for the plant, real-time and historical.

## Prerequisites

To use this integration, you will need a sunsynk-branded e-linter [wifi dongle](https://www.sunsynk.org/logger-support) for your inverter(s) and a [Sunsynk connect](Sunsynk.net) account. This will typically be created by your installer on your behalf. The account needs at least the 'visitor' permissions.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Sensors

The integration exposes the following sensors:

If you have multiple plants (inverters), the sensors represent an aggregated
view of the relevant sensors. For instance battery state of charge, in a typical installation,
as the batteries are on a shared bus, is the max of battery charge reported by both inverters,
while load power will be the sum of the load on each inverter.
The energy totals produce statistics that are usable with the energy dashboard.

## Other considerations

The Sunsynk web api and website seem to be rebranded [e-linter](https://www.e-linter.com) services.
Currently the underlying wrapper [pysunsybkweb](https://github.com/francoisverbeek/pysunsynkweb) has hardcoded
references to Sunsynk. If you are using another brand that uses the same underlying service, get in touch, we may
be able to extend the support to additional tenants of e-linter's infrastructure.

This work is done without Sunsynk or E-linter's involvement or endorsement, based on public documentation.
